\begin{eg}
	If \( A = \{a\} \), then the left ideal generated by \( A \) is:
	\[
		Ra = \{\lambda a \; | \; \lambda \in R\}
	\]
\end{eg}
One can also write the following for the corresponding ideal, the definition is easy to understand by the notation:
\[
	RA \coloneqq \{r_1a_1 + \cdots + r_n a_n \; | \; n \in \ZZ_{>0}, a_i \in A, r_i \in R \; \forall \; i \in \br{1,n} \}
\]
On one hand, since \( R \) contains the identity elements, thus we have \( A \subseteq RA \), one
the other hand, any left ideal containing \( A \) should contain all the finite sums of the element
in the form \( ra \) with \( r\in R, a\in A \), thus \( RA \) is \textbf{precisely} the left ideal
generated by \( A \). Similarly, things happen for \( AR \) and \( RAR \) which corresp. to the
right/2-sided ideal generated by \( A \). Note that when \( R \) is not commutative, the set
\( \{ras \; | \; r,s \in R\} \) is not necessarily the two-sided ideal generated by
\( \mathbf a \) as it is not closed under addition.

\begin{remark}
	\leavevmode
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For any \( A \), we have left/right ideal generated by \( A \) is:
		      \[
			      \sum_{a\in A} Ra \quad (\text{resp. } \sum_{a\in A} aR)
		      \]
		\item If \( A = \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\} \) and \( R \) be a commutative ring, then the ideal generated by \( A \) is denoted as \( (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \), which is:
		      \[
			      (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \coloneqq \{\lambda_1 a_1+\cdots + \lambda_n a_n \; | \; \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n \in R\}
		      \]
		\item We say \( A \) is a \textbf{system of generators} of \( I \), where \( I \) being a left/right/2-sided ideal, if \( I \) is \underline{such} ideal generated by \( A \).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{eg}
	If \( R \) is commutative, a principal ideal in \( R \) is an ideal generated by \( 1 \) element: \( (a), \; a\in R \).
\end{eg}

\begin{proposition}
	Given \( a,b \in R\), see that the following are equivalent:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( b\in (a) \).
		\item \( (b) \subseteq (a) \).
	\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
The proof is quite straightforward, one thing to note is that the containment relations between
ideals, in particular between principal ideals, is seen to capture some of the
\textcolor{red}{arithmetic} of general commutative rings. Notably, the construction of \( (a) \) is
quite like what we did in group theory to contruct cyclic subgroup from an element, which shows the
usage of single or multiple generators.

\subsection{Product of Ideals}

Let \( R \) be commutative ring, \( I_1, \ldots, I_n \subseteq R \) be ideals, then define:
\[
	I_1\cdots I_n = \text{ideal genearted by } \{a_1a_2\cdots a_n \; | \; a_j \in I_j \; \forall \; j\}
\]

This means that it can be written as:
\[
	I_1\cdots I_n \coloneqq  \{\sum_{k=1}^d a_{k_1}a_{k_2}\cdots a_{k_n} \; | \; d\in \ZZ_{>0}, \; a_{k_j}\in I_j \; \forall \; j\}
\]

\begin{eg}
	\leavevmode
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For example:
		      \[
			      I_1 \cdot I_2 = \{\sum_{i=1}^d a_i b_i \; | \; d\in \ZZ_{>0}, a_i \in I_1, b_i \in I_2\}
		      \]
		      Note that the sum here runs over all finite sum.
		\item Let \( f,g \in R \), then:
		      \[
			      (f) \cdot (g) = (fg)
		      \]
	\end{enumerate}
\end{eg}

\begin{note}
	It should be stated clear that
	\[
		I_1 \cdot I_2 \ne \{ab \; | \; a\in I_1, b\in I_2\}
	\]
	RHS is in general not closed under addition, thus \textbf{not} being an \textbf{ideal}.
\end{note}

Suppose that \( f: R \to S \) be a ring homomorphism of commutative rings. If \( I\subseteq R \) be an ideal, what can we say about \( f(I) \)?
\begin{itemize}
	\item \( f(I) \subseteq S \) is a subgroup.
	\item \( f(I) \) is not necessarily an ideal, and it is if and only if \( f \) is
	      \textbf{surjective}.
\end{itemize}

Thus we can look into the ideal generated by \( f(I) \), which is denoted by \( IS \) or \( I\cdot S \):
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:image-gen-ideal}
	IS \coloneqq \{\sum_{j=1}^n a_j f(b_j) \; | \; n \in \ZZ_{>0}, \; a_j \in S, \; b_j \in I\}
\end{equation}

\begin{eg}
	Suppose that \( S = T^{-1}R \) where \( T\subseteq R \) be a multiplicative system. Let \( I \subseteq R \) be an ideal. See that:
	\[
		IS = T^{-1}I = \{\frac{a}{s} \; | \; a\in I, \; s\in T\}
	\]
\end{eg}

\section{Spectrum of a Commutative Ring}

This connects closely on topology. Basically it allow us to glue several ring to get some geometric shape.

\begin{definition}
	Given a commutative ring \( R \), define:
	\[
		\spec R \coloneqq  \{\mathfrak p \subset R \; | \; \mathfrak p \text{ is prime ideal.}\}
	\]

	For every ideal (not necessarily prime) \( I \subset R \), let
	\[
		V(I) \coloneqq  \{\mathfrak p \in \spec R \; | \; I \subseteq \mathfrak p\}
	\]
\end{definition}

Note that we consider it as some sort of topology with closed set being \( V(I) \) for some \( I \subset R \) being ideal.

\begin{proposition}
	We have a topology on \( \spec R \), s.t. the \textbf{closed sets} are the \( V(I) \) for \( I \subseteq R \).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	To verify topology property we basically need to check:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \( \spec R = V(I) \) for some \( I \).

		      This follows by taking \( I = \{0\} \).
		\item \( \emptyset = V(I) \) for some \( I \).

		      This follows by taking \( I = R \).
		\item \( \forall \; (I_\alpha) \) be ideals in \( R \), we have
		      \[
			      \bigcap_{\alpha \in \Lambda} V(I_\alpha) = V(J) \quad \text{ for some } J
		      \]

		      Consider let \( P \in \bigcap_{\alpha}V(I_\alpha) \iff P \supseteq I_{\alpha} \; \forall \; \alpha \iff P\subseteq \sum_{\alpha \in \Lambda}I_\alpha\). So this follows by taking \( J = \sum_{\alpha} I_\alpha \).
		\item \( \forall \) ideals \( I_1, I_2 \subseteq R \), we have:
		      \[
			      V(I_1) \cup V(I_2) = V(J) \quad \text{ for some } J
		      \]

		      We try to show that \( V(I_1) \cup V(I_2) = V(I_1\cap I_2) \), the ``\( \subseteq \)'' part is clear simply by the fact that \( I_1\cap I_2 \subseteq I_1 \) and \( I_1\cap I_2 \subseteq I_2 \). Now suppose that \( P \in V(I_1\cap I_2) \), then see that \( I_1\cap I_2 \subseteq P \). If \( I_1\not\subseteq P, I_2 \not\subseteq P \implies \exists \; x_1\in I_1 - P, \; x_2 \in I_2 - P \), s.t. \( x_1x_2 \in I_1 \cap I_2 \) (follows by ideal property) but \( x_1 x_2 \not\in P \) since \( P \) is prime ideal, and reason by contraposition. This leads to contradiction $\lightning$. Hence by contradiction, either \( P \supseteq I_1 \) or \( P \supseteq I_2 \), thus \( P \in V(I_1) \cup V(I_2) \).
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{note}
		Note that the formula only holds for ideal \( I_1, I_2 \subseteq R \):
		\[
			V(I_1) \cup V(I_2) = V (I_1 \cap I_2)
		\]
	\end{note}
\end{proof}

\begin{eg}
	Let \( R = \ZZ \implies \) the prime ideals are \textbf{precisely} \( \{\{0\}, p\ZZ \text{ for }
	p \text{ prime}\} \)\todo{see next time every ideal is principal in this case}. Then:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( \{p\ZZ\} \) are closed.
		\item \( \overline{\{(0)\}} = \overline{\{0\}} = \spec(\ZZ) \).
	\end{itemize}
\end{eg}
In fact, we can define \( \spec \) as \textbf{functor} as follows:
\[
	\underline{\text{CommutativeRings}} \longrightarrow \underline{\Top^\circ}
\]
where LHS is the category of commutative rings, and the RHS is the dual of the category of topological spaces.

First recall the definition of a functor:

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Functor}]
	\label{def:functor}
	If \( \cC \) and \( \cD \) are categories, then a functor:
	\[
		F: \cC \to \cD
	\]

	is given by:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For every \( X \in \ob(\cC) \), we have \( F(X) \in \ob(\cD) \).
		\item For all \( X, Y \in \ob(\cC) \), we have a map
		      \[
			      \Hom_\cC(X,Y) \to \Hom_\cD(F(X), F(Y))
		      \]

		      s.t.
		      \begin{enumerate}
			      \item \( F(1_X) = 1_{F(X)} \quad \forall \; X \in \ob(\cC)\).
			      \item \( \forall \; u \in \Hom_\cC(X,Y), v \in \Hom_\cC(Y,Z) \), preserving the composition structures of the morphisms.
			            \[
				            F(u\circ v) = F(v) \circ F(u)
			            \]
		      \end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


If \( f: R \to S \supseteq P \) to be a ring homomorphism between commutative rings, one can define:
\[
	\begin{aligned}
		f^\# : \spec(S) & \to \spec(R) \\
		f^\# (P)        & = f^{-1} (P)
	\end{aligned}
\]

We know that \( f^{-1}(P) \subseteq R \) is an ideal, it's ``inverse'' is ``surjective'', notably to see that it is actually a \textbf{prime ideal}:
\[
	\text{If } xy \in f^{-1}(P) \implies f(xy) = f(x) f(y) \in P \implies f(x) \in P \text{ or } f(y) \in P \implies x\in f^{-1}(P) \text{ or } y \in f^{-1}(P)
\]

\begin{claim}
	\( f^\# \) is \textbf{continuous}.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
	It is enough to show that \( (f^\#)^{-1} \)(closed set) is also closed.

	Fix \( I \subseteq R \) be an ideal, then:
	\[
		(f^\#)^{-1} (V(I)) = \{P \subseteq S \; | \; P \text{ prime. } f^\#(P)\supseteq I \iff f^{-1}(P) \supseteq I \iff P \supseteq f(I) \iff P \supseteq IS \;\; \ref{eq:image-gen-ideal}\}
	\]

	Thus we can conclude: \( (f^\#)^{-1}(V(I)) = V(IS) \) which is closed.
\end{proof}
To check that it is a functor, need:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \( (\Id_R)^\# = \Id_{\spec R} \), which is clear.
	\item The following is true since \( (g\circ f)^{-1} (P) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(P)) \):
	      \[
		      \begin{aligned}
			      R \xrightarrow{f} S & \xrightarrow{g} T \\
			      (g\circ f)^\# =     & f^\# \circ g^\#
		      \end{aligned}
	      \]
\end{enumerate}
We can actually also do similar things for maximal ideal!

\begin{remark}
	May consider:
	\[
		\maxspec(R) \coloneqq  \{P \subset R \; | \; P \text{ maximal ideal.}\} \subseteq \spec(R) \text{ w.r.t. subspace topology.}
	\]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It \textbf{doesn't} give a functor in general.
		\item It indeed \textbf{well-behaved} and useful in geometry if \( R \) is a quotient of a
		      polynomial ring, namely: \( \frac{\KK[x_1, \ldots,x_n]}{I} \) where \( \KK \) be a field,
		      and in this case, it indeed \textbf{gives a functor}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
